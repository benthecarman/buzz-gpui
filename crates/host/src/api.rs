//! The host protocol: what a GUI can ask an agent host, and what the host
//! pushes back.
//!
//! These types are ours, not the controller's, so a host and a GUI built
//! from different controller revisions still understand each other; fields
//! one side does not know default.
//!
//! The v1 agent requests are gone with the v1 agents. A host answers an
//! older GUI's v1 request as one it does not support, as it answers any
//! request it cannot read, and a GUI skips an older host's v1 snapshot
//! events as it skips any event it cannot read.
