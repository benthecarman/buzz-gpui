//! Agents2: agents that are types from the start (buzz-app's
//! `features/agents2`). A compiled-in agent type ([`AgentType`]) gives its
//! summary line, peek view, settings tabs and `run`. Each agent made from
//! it has its own key held by an agent host (`buzz_host::api::AppAgentRequest`),
//! an `agent-attention/v1` configuration the app owns and edits, and a
//! config value the type owns. The app delivers matching live events to
//! `run` from the stream the owner already receives in the agent's
//! community, selected or not, so no type opens a socket of its own.
//!
//! - [`registry`]: the [`AgentType`] trait and [`register_type`].
//! - [`runtime`]: what a run receives ([`Delivery`], [`AgentHandle`]).
//! - [`attention`] and [`store`]: the attention format and local records.
//! - [`objects`]: the agent's own one-object reads and writes of it.
//! - [`Agents2`]: the service, a GPUI entity reachable with
//!   [`Agents2::global`].
